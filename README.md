Image Compression using K-Means algorithm.

The script uses K-Means, a Machine Learning clustering algorithm, to cluster all the colors in an image into 16 clusters 
and replace the RGB value of every pixel with the RGB value of their respective cluster center and thus reducing the amount 
of memory required to save a picture.

Requirements

1. Python
2. numpy
3. matplotlib
4. Scipy

Instructions
Download script.py in your required directory

Note
Use a .png file as JPEG uses lossy compression which may lead to undesired result.
